## Prerequisites

Before you begin working with this portfolio template, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later): The JavaScript runtime that powers the development environment.
- **pnpm** (v6 or later): A fast, disk space-efficient package manager alternative to npm.
- **Git** (optional): For version control and deployment to platforms like GitHub Pages.

You should also have a basic understanding of:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals
- Vue.js basics (components, props, events)
- Terminal/command line usage

If you're new to any of these technologies, don't worry! This guide includes detailed explanations and resources to help you get started.

## Project Setup

### Installing Dependencies

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd my-vue-portfolio
```

3. Install the project dependencies using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This command will install all the necessary dependencies defined in the `package.json` file, including Vue.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and Font Awesome.

### Running the Development Server

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This command starts the Vite development server, which provides features like hot module replacement (HMR) for a smooth development experience. Once the server is running, you can access your portfolio application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL displayed in your terminal).

The development server will automatically reload the page whenever you make changes to the source files, allowing you to see your updates in real-time.

## Project Structure

Understanding the project structure is essential for effective customization. Here's an overview of the key directories and files:

```

## Customization Guide

### Personalizing Your Portfolio

#### Updating Personal Information

To personalize your portfolio with your own information, you'll need to modify several components:

1. **About Section (src/views/AboutSection.vue)**:
   - Replace the placeholder text in the "About Me" section with your own biography.
   - Update the skills badges to reflect your actual skills.
   - Replace the placeholder profile image with your own photo.

2. **Projects Section (src/views/ProjectsSection.vue)**:
   - Replace the placeholder projects with your own projects.
   - Update project titles, descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos or code repositories.
   - Replace placeholder images with screenshots of your actual projects.

3. **Skills Section (src/views/SkillsSection.vue)**:
   - Adjust the skill percentages to accurately reflect your proficiency levels.
   - Add or remove skills based on your expertise.
   - Update the tools and technologies section with the ones you actually use.

4. **Contact Section (src/views/ContactSection.vue)**:
   - Update the contact information with your actual email, location, and phone number.
   - Modify the social media links to point to your profiles.

5. **Header and Footer (src/components/TheHeader.vue and src/components/TheFooter.vue)**:
   - Update the portfolio title in the header.
   - Modify social media links in the footer to point to your profiles.

### Customizing the Theme

The portfolio uses DaisyUI themes, which makes it easy to change the color scheme:

1. **Modifying the Theme Selection**:

Open `tailwind.config.js` and update the DaisyUI themes configuration:

```javascript
daisyui: {
  themes: ["light", "dark", "corporate"], // Add or remove themes as needed
}
```

DaisyUI offers many built-in themes like "cupcake", "bumblebee", "emerald", "corporate", "synthwave", "retro", "cyberpunk", etc. You can find the full list in the [DaisyUI documentation](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/).

2. **Changing the Default Theme**:

To change the default theme, modify the theme initialization in `src/components/TheHeader.vue`:

```javascript
// Initialize theme on component mount
if (isDarkTheme.value) {
  document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark'); // Change 'dark' to your preferred theme
} else {
  document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light'); // Change 'light' to your preferred theme
}
```

3. **Custom Theme Colors**:

You can also create custom themes by extending the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: '#4f46e5', // Replace with your preferred primary color
      secondary: '#f43f5e', // Replace with your preferred secondary color
      // Add more custom colors as needed
    },
  },
},
```

### Adding New Sections

To add a new section to your portfolio:

1. Create a new Vue component in the `src/views/` directory.
2. Design your section using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI components.
3. Import and add the new component to `src/App.vue`.

Example of adding a new "Testimonials" section:

```vue
<!-- src/views/TestimonialsSection.vue -->
<template>
  <section id="testimonials" class="py-16 bg-base-100">
    <div class="container mx-auto px-4">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-8">Testimonials</h2>
      <!-- Your testimonials content here -->
    </div>
  </section>
</template>
```

Then in `src/App.vue`:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="min-h-screen flex flex-col">
    <TheHeader />
    
    <main class="flex-grow">
      <AboutSection />
      <ProjectsSection />
      <SkillsSection />
      <TestimonialsSection /> <!-- Add your new section here -->
      <ContactSection />
    </main>
    
    <TheFooter />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import TheHeader from './components/TheHeader.vue';
import TheFooter from './components/TheFooter.vue';
import AboutSection from './views/AboutSection.vue';
import ProjectsSection from './views/ProjectsSection.vue';
import SkillsSection from './views/SkillsSection.vue';
import TestimonialsSection from './views/TestimonialsSection.vue'; // Import your new component
import ContactSection from './views/ContactSection.vue';
</script>
```

## Development Workflow

### Best Practices

When working on your portfolio, consider these best practices:

1. **Component-Based Development**: Keep your components small and focused on a single responsibility.
2. **Mobile-First Approach**: Design for mobile devices first, then enhance for larger screens.
3. **Consistent Styling**: Use Tailwind's utility classes consistently to maintain a cohesive look.
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure your portfolio is accessible by using semantic HTML and appropriate ARIA attributes.
5. **Performance**: Optimize images and minimize unnecessary dependencies to keep your site fast.

### Using Font Awesome Icons

The portfolio is set up with Font Awesome icons. To use them in your components:

```vue
<template>
  <font-awesome-icon :icon="['fas', 'user']" /> <!-- Solid style icon -->
  <font-awesome-icon :icon="['fab', 'github']" /> <!-- Brand icon -->
  <font-awesome-icon :icon="['far', 'envelope']" /> <!-- Regular style icon -->
</template>
```

You can browse available icons in the [Font Awesome documentation](https://fontawesome.com/icons).

### Working with DaisyUI Components

DaisyUI provides a collection of pre-designed components built on top of Tailwind CSS. To use them:

1. Browse the [DaisyUI documentation](https://daisyui.com/components/) to find components you want to use.
2. Copy the HTML structure and modify it to fit your needs.
3. Customize the components using Tailwind utility classes.

Example of using a DaisyUI card component:

```vue
<div class="card bg-base-100 shadow-xl">
  <figure><img src="..." alt="..." /></figure>
  <div class="card-body">
    <h2 class="card-title">Card Title</h2>
    <p>Card content goes here...</p>
    <div class="card-actions justify-end">
      <button class="btn btn-primary">Action</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Building for Production

When you're ready to deploy your portfolio, you need to build it for production:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This command compiles and minifies your application for production deployment. The built files will be placed in the `dist` directory, ready to be deployed to a web server.

The production build process:

1. Compiles Vue components into optimized JavaScript
2. Processes and minifies CSS with Tailwind's purge feature to remove unused styles
3. Optimizes assets for production
4. Generates static HTML files

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Static Hosting Services

You can deploy your portfolio to various static hosting services:

#### GitHub Pages

1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Build your project: `pnpm run build`
3. Deploy using the `gh-pages` package (you may need to install it first):

```bash
pnpm add -D gh-pages
```

Add this to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
pnpm run deploy
```

#### Netlify

1. Create an account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
2. Connect your GitHub repository.
3. Configure the build settings:
   - Build command: `pnpm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`

#### Vercel

1. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
2. Import your project from GitHub.
3. Vercel will automatically detect it as a Vue.js project and configure the build settings.

### Option 2: Traditional Web Hosting

If you prefer traditional web hosting:

1. Build your project: `pnpm run build`
2. Upload the contents of the `dist` directory to your web server using FTP or your hosting provider's file manager.

## Extending the Portfolio

### Adding a Blog Section

To add a blog section to your portfolio:

1. Create a new component for the blog list and individual blog posts.
2. Consider using Markdown for blog content with packages like `markdown-it` or `vue-markdown`.
3. Store blog posts as Markdown files or fetch them from a headless CMS.

### Implementing a Dark Mode Toggle

The portfolio already includes a theme toggle in the header component. If you want to customize it further:

1. Modify the theme toggle logic in `src/components/TheHeader.vue`.
2. Update the icons and styling to match your design preferences.
3. Consider adding more theme options beyond just light and dark.

### Adding Animations

To enhance your portfolio with animations:

1. Consider using CSS transitions for simple animations.
2. For more complex animations, you can use libraries like GSAP or Motion One.
3. Implement scroll-triggered animations for section entrances.

Example of adding a fade-in animation with CSS:

```css
.fade-in {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

.fade-in.visible {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

Then use JavaScript to add the `visible` class when elements enter the viewport.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Icons Not Displaying

**Solution**: Ensure you've properly imported and registered Font Awesome icons in `main.js` and are using the correct icon names and prefixes.

#### Issue: Tailwind Classes Not Applied

**Solution**: Check that your `tailwind.config.js` file correctly includes all your template files in the `content` array.

#### Issue: Build Errors

**Solution**: Check the console for specific error messages. Common issues include:
- Missing dependencies: Run `pnpm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Syntax errors: Look for typos or incorrect syntax in your Vue components.
- Path issues: Ensure all import paths are correct.

#### Issue: Responsive Design Problems

**Solution**: Use browser developer tools to test different screen sizes and adjust your Tailwind responsive classes accordingly.
